# ðŸŽ¯ Terminal Darts Game - 501

A realistic terminal-based darts simulation game that follows proper 501 darts rules with accuracy-based gameplay.

## Features

- **Authentic 501 Darts Rules**: Start with 501 points, must finish on a double
- **Customizable Accuracy**: Set your own accuracy percentages for singles, doubles, and triples
- **Smart Miss Patterns**: When you miss, you hit nearby segments on the dartboard (not random areas)
- **Realistic Miss Logic**: Singles and triples never miss the board entirely (only doubles can)
- **Proper Turn Management**: 3 darts per turn with bust detection
- **Input Validation**: Invalid inputs don't consume darts - you can re-enter your aim
- **Complete Game Flow**: Score tracking, turn summaries, and win conditions

## Installation & Running

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Download `darts_game.py`
3. Run the game:

```bash
python3 darts_game.py
```

## How to Play

### Input Format
- **Singles**: `s20` (single 20 = 20 points)
- **Doubles**: `d19` (double 19 = 38 points)  
- **Triples**: `t20` (triple 20 = 60 points)
- **Outer Bull**: `ob` (25 points)
- **Double Bull**: `db` (50 points)
- **Default**: Just press Enter to aim for `t20` (most common target)

### Game Rules
- Start with 501 points
- Each turn consists of up to 3 darts
- Subtract your score from 501
- Must finish exactly on 0 with a double
- **Bust conditions**: Score goes below 0 or lands on exactly 1
- When you bust, your score resets to what it was at the start of the turn

## Game Mechanics

### Customizable Accuracy Settings
At game start, you can set your own accuracy percentages (1-100%) for each target type:
- **Singles accuracy**: How often you hit singles when aiming for them [default: 80%]
- **Doubles accuracy**: How often you hit doubles when aiming for them [default: 15%]
- **Triples accuracy**: How often you hit triples when aiming for them [default: 10%]

Simply press Enter to use the defaults, or enter your own percentages to customize the difficulty.

### Realistic Miss Patterns
When you miss your target, the game simulates realistic dart throws:
- **Adjacent Segments**: Most likely to hit segments next to your target (e.g., aiming for 20 might hit 1 or 5)
- **Same Segment Different Multiplier**: Might hit single 20 when aiming for triple 20
- **Complete Miss**: Only possible when aiming for doubles (narrow outer ring) or bulls - singles and triples always hit something on the board

### Dartboard Layout
The dartboard segments in clockwise order: 20, 1, 18, 4, 13, 6, 10, 15, 2, 17, 3, 19, 7, 16, 8, 11, 14, 9, 12, 5
