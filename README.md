# ðŸŽ¯ Terminal Darts Game - 501

A realistic terminal-based darts simulation game that follows proper 501 darts rules with accuracy-based gameplay.

## Features

- **Authentic 501 Darts Rules**: Start with 501 points, must finish on a double
- **Realistic Accuracy Simulation**: Different hit rates for singles (80%), doubles (15%), and triples (10%)
- **Smart Miss Patterns**: When you miss, you hit nearby segments on the dartboard (not random areas)
- **Proper Turn Management**: 3 darts per turn with bust detection
- **Input Validation**: Invalid inputs don't consume darts - you can re-enter your aim
- **Complete Game Flow**: Score tracking, turn summaries, and win conditions

## Installation & Running

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Download `darts_game.py`
3. Run the game:

```bash
python3 darts_game.py
```

## How to Play

### Input Format
- **Singles**: `s20` (single 20 = 20 points)
- **Doubles**: `d19` (double 19 = 38 points)  
- **Triples**: `t20` (triple 20 = 60 points)
- **Outer Bull**: `ob` (25 points)
- **Double Bull**: `db` (50 points)

### Game Rules
- Start with 501 points
- Each turn consists of up to 3 darts
- Subtract your score from 501
- Must finish exactly on 0 with a double
- **Bust conditions**: Score goes below 0 or lands on exactly 1
- When you bust, your score resets to what it was at the start of the turn

## Game Mechanics

### Accuracy Rates
- **Singles**: 80% chance to hit what you aim for
- **Doubles**: 15% chance to hit what you aim for  
- **Triples**: 10% chance to hit what you aim for

### Realistic Misses
When you miss your target, the game simulates realistic dart throws:
- **Adjacent Segments**: Most likely to hit segments next to your target (e.g., aiming for 20 might hit 1 or 5)
- **Same Segment Different Multiplier**: Might hit single 20 when aiming for triple 20
- **Complete Miss**: Occasionally miss the board entirely

### Dartboard Layout
The dartboard segments in clockwise order: 20, 1, 18, 4, 13, 6, 10, 15, 2, 17, 3, 19, 7, 16, 8, 11, 14, 9, 12, 5

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Invalid Input Handling**: Notice how `t60` was rejected and didn't consume a dart
2. **Realistic Misses**: Aiming for `t20` hit `s1` (adjacent segment) and `s5` (adjacent segment)
3. **Accuracy Simulation**: Mix of hits and misses based on target difficulty
4. **Bust Detection**: Attempting `s1` with 396 remaining would leave 395 (can't finish)
5. **Double Finish**: Game ends only when finishing on a double

## Technical Implementation

- **Python 3.6+** with type hints
- **Dartboard Model**: Accurate segment adjacency mapping
- **Probability Engine**: Weighted random selection for realistic gameplay
- **Input Parsing**: Regex-based validation with clear error messages
- **Game State Management**: Proper score tracking and turn management
